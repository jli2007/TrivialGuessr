üåç THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS! Think beyond cities, although cities are valid and promoted, need a good variety:
- Remote locations (Nemo Point, most isolated spot on Earth)
- Natural landmarks (specific trees, rocks, caves, waterfalls)
- Underwater locations (Titanic wreck, deepest ocean trench)
- Arctic/Antarctic research stations
- Desert oases, mountain peaks, volcanic craters
- Battlefields, crash sites, archaeological digs
- Tiny islands, lighthouses, bridges
- Famous intersections, borders, monuments
- Elevation, Murder Rate, birth rate, world-statistics
- Architecture, man-made-wonders, fun-facts (town/city related)

üìö EXAMPLE EXCELLENT QUESTIONS:
- "Where is Point Nemo, the most remote spot on Earth where dead satellites are dumped?"
- "Where stands the 9,000-year-old tree that survived ice ages and is still alive today?"
- "Which forest location was the site of the Christmas Truce soccer game during WWI?"
- "Where did the Enola Gay take off to drop the atomic bomb, from a runway now used for civilian flights?"
- "Which tiny island served as Napoleon's final prison, where he died eating wallpaper with arsenic?"
- "Where is the underwater hotel room where you sleep surrounded by sharks?"
- "Which lighthouse was the last thing Titanic passengers saw before hitting the iceberg?"
- "Where did a single tree deflect a cannonball and save an entire village in 1645?"
- "Which specific forest grove is considered the most haunted place on Earth by paranormal investigators?"
- "Where is the restaurant built inside a 737 airplane that never flew?"

üéØ CATEGORY INSPIRATION FOR ${request.category}:
- Ancient mysteries and lost civilizations
- Bizarre accidents and freak incidents  
- Scientific discoveries made by accident
- Last known locations of extinct species

5-6: Moderately known places requiring some education (Machu Picchu, Petra)
7-8: Obscure but interesting locations (specific battle sites, unique natural formations)
9-10: Extremely specific or recently discovered places (research stations, archaeological sites)

TARGET DIFFICULTY: ${request.difficulty}/10

‚ö° REQUIREMENTS:
- Any pinpointable location with exact coordinates (lat/lng)
- Rich storytelling with specific details, dates, numbers
- Educational and memorable
- Global representation based on logical population splits
- Include dramatic human stories when possible
- Vary between cities, natural locations, and unique spots
- Ensure coordinates are precise and accurate
