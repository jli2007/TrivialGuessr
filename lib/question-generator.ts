üåç THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS! Think beyond cities, although cities are valid and promoted, need a good variety:
- Remote locations (Nemo Point, most isolated spot on Earth)
- Natural landmarks (specific trees, rocks, caves, waterfalls)
- Underwater locations (Titanic wreck, deepest ocean trench)
- Arctic/Antarctic research stations
- Desert oases, mountain peaks, volcanic craters
- Battlefields, crash sites, archaeological digs
- Tiny islands, lighthouses, bridges
- Famous intersections, borders, monuments
- Elevation, Murder Rate, birth rate, world-statistics
- Architecture, man-made-wonders, fun-facts (town/city related)

üìö EXAMPLE EXCELLENT QUESTIONS:
- "Where is Point Nemo, the most remote spot on Earth where dead satellites are dumped?"
- "Where stands the 9,000-year-old tree that survived ice ages and is still alive today?"
- "Which forest location was the site of the Christmas Truce soccer game during WWI?"
- "Where did the Enola Gay take off to drop the atomic bomb, from a runway now used for civilian flights?"
- "Which tiny island served as Napoleon's final prison, where he died eating wallpaper with arsenic?"
- "Where is the world-renowned underwater hotel room where you sleep surrounded by sharks?"
- "Which lighthouse was the last thing Titanic passengers saw before hitting the iceberg?"
- "Where did a single tree deflect a cannonball and save an entire village in 1645?"
- "Which specific forest grove is considered the most haunted place on Earth by paranormal investigators?"
- "Where is the restaurant built inside a 737 airplane that never flew?"
- "What field did Lionel Messi first play football?"

üéØ EXAMPLE NICHE QUESTIONS (HAVE LESS OF THIS):
- Ancient mysteries and lost civilizations
- Bizarre accidents and freak incidents  
- Scientific discoveries made by accident
- Last known locations of extinct species
- Sites of impossible survival stories
- Places where history changed in minutes
- Locations of unsolved mysteries
- Spots where nature defied physics
- Where human error caused major events
- Secret locations revealed decades later

üó∫Ô∏è GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION (logical population-based split):
- Asia (27-40%): China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, etc.
- Europe (25-30%): UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Netherlands, Switzerland, etc.
- North America (15-20%): USA, Canada, Mexico
- Africa (10-21%): Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Morocco, Ethiopia, etc.
- South America (6-16%): Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Chile, etc.
- Oceania (4-8%): Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands

Include questions from ALL continents, with major countries getting more representation but don't forget smaller fascinating places like:
- Bhutan's unique carbon-negative policies
- San Marino's tiny republic quirks
- Liechtenstein's double-landlocked oddities
- Vatican City's papal secrets
- Monaco's gambling history
- Tuvalu's climate change struggles

üé≤ DIFFICULTY SCALE - ASSIGN APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY (1-10) FOR EACH QUESTION:
1-2: Famous landmarks everyone knows (Eiffel Tower, Great Wall, Statue of Liberty)
3-4: Well-known cities and major historical events (Berlin Wall, Pearl Harbor, Rome Colosseum)
5-6: Moderately known places requiring some education (Machu Picchu, Petra, Angkor Wat)
7-8: Obscure but interesting locations (specific battle sites, unique natural formations, lesser-known historical sites, niche locations)
9-10: Extremely specific or recently discovered places (research stations, archaeological sites, very niche locations)

üß† LLM DIFFICULTY ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze each question's obscurity level
- Consider how many people would reasonably know this location
- Factor in historical significance vs. general awareness
- Famous tourist destinations = lower difficulty
- Specific historical events/scientific locations = higher difficulty
- Recent discoveries or very niche places = highest difficulty

‚ö° REQUIREMENTS:
- Any pinpointable location with exact coordinates (lat/lng)
- Rich storytelling with specific details, dates, numbers
- **DO NOT MENTION THE CITY/REGION IN THE QUESTION ITSELF, CONTINENT AT MOST. THIS GIVES THE ANSWER AWAY**
- ie do not have "Where in Kenya is ..."
- Educational and memorable
- Global representation based on logical population splits
- Include dramatic human stories when possible
- Vary between cities, natural locations, and unique spots
- Ensure coordinates are precise and accurate
- **ASSIGN REALISTIC DIFFICULTY 1-10 BASED ON QUESTION OBSCURITY**
- For fun fact, make it sort of like a "hint" to the location without giving the location, and to not add exclamation marks when not necessary.
